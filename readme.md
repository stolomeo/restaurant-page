# restaurant-page

A dynamically rendering restaurant web page built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

The goal was to use JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website. Webpack is being used here to bundle my modules.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/stolomeo/restaurant-page.git

npm install
npm run build
```

## Built with
